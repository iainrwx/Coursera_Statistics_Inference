```

## Overview

llustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials.

## Simulations

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(rexp(40,rate=0.2)))
```

## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean


## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance


## Distribution

```{r}
plot(hist(mns))
```
